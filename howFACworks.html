Follow these steps to calculate the estimated ACEF/X amounts.

Several inputs are needed to calculate the estimations:
•	planning year budget (for comparison with total estimation)
•	total initial award counts for new FTIC (from merit scholarship consideration process)
•	initial amounts by tier
•	proportion of tier to break down the total initial award

Step 1: Determine the budget amount and total initial award counts.
Step 2: Choose the restoration goal. This goal can be selected from four option and will apply from aid year two to four (Aid 2 to 4).

•	Average: average retention rate by aid year from 2017 to 2021
•	Maximum: the highest retention rate by aid year
•	Minimum: the lowest retention rate by aid year 
•	Custom: user-specified goal for the restoration rate

Step 3: Determine the initial award amount (ACEF) and number of awards for each tier for the new FTIC (Aid 1).
•	Initial amounts: different amount for each tier
•	Initial tier proportion: distributed total awards for each tier, total must equal 1

Step 4: Check the total estimated amount by looking at estimated ACEF/X amount by aid year in the table (row name “Total” and column name “Fcst2023”) and 
the initial budget.

Step 5: Click on any cell in the table for the full detailed output.

Step 6: Adjust parameters such as initial total award counts, restoration rate, first aid year amount, and 
count to reduce the gap between the budget and estimation.

Note: the expected amounts for Aid 2 to 4 were calculated using the average awarded amount from the previous aid year since 
students are awarded similar amounts from the beginning; expected counts were based on the previous tier proportion since 
there are no additional new awards after the first year.
